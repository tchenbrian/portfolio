     <h2 class="infoHeader">Overview</h2> 
        <p class="infoPara">Studio C was a classroom internship I was involved in and an important step as a Web Designer. Assignments and projects were taken beyond the traditional classroom setting as I fulfilled requests from real clients on a daily basis in order to simulate the work environment. Initially, I was the the manager of the content department; after realizing I could contribute more as a programmer, I transferred to the coding department.</p>         
 
        <h2 class="infoHeader">Achievements</h2>
        <p class="infoPara">My current vocation is in design, both in web and graphics. In the course of two years, I have developed proficiency in graphic design and web design. I have successfully taken on several clients and have designed for commercial and educational purposes. Finally, I have earned Adobe certifications in Illustrator and Photoshop. </p>
