     <h2 class="infoHeader">Overview</h2> 
        <p class="infoPara">Studio C was a classroom internship I was involved in and an important step as a Web Designer. Assignments and projects were taken beyond the traditional classroom setting as I fulfilled requests from real clients on a daily basis in order to simulate the work environment. Initially, I was the the manager of the content department; after realizing I could contribute more as a programmer, I transferred to the coding department.</p>

        <p class="infoPara">Creating Community Impact is a job development company that seeks to assist individuals in finding sustainable employment that meets the needs of each individual.

        <p class="infoPara">Studio C was asked by the Nevada Parent Teacher Association to create a mobile app similar to the Colorado PTA App. I was assigned to gather content for the app to assist Robert Casarotto, who programmed the app using Ionic.</p>
        
        <h2 class="infoHeader">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="infoPara">Studio C was a wonderful experience for me to grow as a leader and also understand how a real business operates. I am glad to have participated as a manager and as a programmer so I could see all perspectives. Even though there were struggles at times, I believe that our class was quite successful.</p>
