     <h2 class="infoHeader">Overview</h2> 
        
        <p class="infoPara">The senior capstone, a requirement for graduation, is the most important long-term project of my high school tenure. It demonstrates my experience and prowess gained over the course of four years in a year-long project designed to solve a real world problem using my web design skills. My website, titled The Happiness Project, addresses common social issues that adolescents and young adults face in their lives.</p>

        <h2 class="infoHeader">Reflection</h2> 
        
        <p class="infoPara">The Senior Capstone was a transformative process as a student, web designer, and individual heading off into college. As my partner and I concluded our question and answer session following the presentation at the Innevation Center, the first emotions I felt were relief and satisfaction. My goal of creating a useful product that could benefit a major area of society outside of school actually happened. I did not stumble or faint during the presentation either, which was a bonus. Of course, the entire process was not perfect, but each mistake made provided me a learning experience and a way to improve in the future. From partner selection to actually coding the website, I am content with the choices I made and glad that our vision for the project came to fruition.
