        <p class="sliderText">Adobe Voice was a new software that we learned. For this project, we had to form groups of four to five and sell a pitch for the annual Flight to Europe hosted by the foreign language department. To do so, we relied on our persuasive skills and speaking as well as the handy capabilities of the technology. Our videos were high-quality and made many want to visit Germany over the summer.</p>

        <p class="sliderText">The first week back in school for Graphic Design was one for creativity. Each of us participated in several activities that would test our creativity ingenuity and then watch TED talks that explain the thinking process. One speaker even encouraged us that high school students should be playing more. We culminated this week of creativity with a project to make something of value out of accumulated trash. With a bit of effort, we constructed a neat-looking movie theater.</p>

        <p class="sliderText">In Adobe Flash, my first major work was an animation of a fable of my choice. Over the course of the project, I had to make some interesting decisions in regards to graphics and director details. The overall process was a great introduction to Flash. I struggled a bit at first, but I quickly improved at the program and designed a well-put fable animation.</p>

The learning experience was through a design of a video game with custom graphics and programming. The game ended up functioning well and appearing nicely and I definitely have a better understanding of ActionScript.</p>

        <p class="sliderText">Hip Hop Meets IT was an event that had two worlds meet: Computer Science and Hip Hop. As two radically different things, we were in teaching young hip hop students about computer science in exchange for learning hip hop dance. It was an absolutely wonderful experience, both in the cultural exchance and meeting new people. My class was responsible for the graphics portion of the teaching session, specifically Photoshop. We ran through a successful short tutorial on how to accessorize someone in Photoshop, which the kids found a lot of fun.</p>

        <p class="sliderText">Hour of Code is the annual special hour when students all across the globe learn computer science, which is quickly becoming a prominent career path. This year was different for us SWCTA students, however. We had to teach computer science at Mark Finn Elementary School. Thankfully, we managed to adjust for the kids and show them some fun games to help them start making connections to coding and computers. It was a pleasurable experience to work with elementary schoolers again.</p>

My English teacher requested an educational website for upcoming sophomores that are asked to read The Inferno by Dante Alighieri. Teaming up in a group of five, we each had to make careful considerations of color scheme, client needs, and target audience. The information provided was accurate and informative, and the website ended up being presentable and organized.</p>

I attributed that motto to qualities such as progress, idealism, and technology and incorporated those elements into my designs. In retrospect, they both were visually appealing and symbolizing, something that I could appreciate in my graphic design work.</p>

Our latest clients were the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, the regional development company in Southern Nevada. For our work this time, we had to be more precise in conveying Nevada and the global reach of LVGEA. My two logos were simple and a bit lackluster, but they managed to be presentable and attempted to represent Nevada.</p>

We designed logos celebrating 80 years of Marketing Education as its anniversary was around the corner. I made it into the top ten with a very simple and clean logo that could also convey the anniversary feeling with subtlety. </p>

        <p class="sliderText">The next website we completed was a redesign of the negatively received SWCTA site. We had to make it more logical, easier to navigate, and more appealing. To top it off, the next skill we learned was responsive design, which we learned throughout second quarter. This project was a hassle because of the specific requirements, but my group and I managed to pull it through. I am most satisfied with this work because I was able to make the site fully responsive while still looking visually clean and appealing.</p>

Our exploration included discoveries of fonts, colors, and images that would relate to our theme. The following year, we took these ideas and put them into one final project. I can admit that my end product was a bit rushed, but the idea of "second chances" is definitely present throughout the design.</p>

We were in groups of five and had to manage designing, modeling, building, and video documenting. This was one of the most stressful projects I have completed. I found the aspect of modeling to be difficult and we ended up crunching for time.</p>

In groups, we had to develop, sketch, and draw our ideas for the shoes that had to relate to four themes: music, Las Vegas, action sports, and art. Our designs were polished and neat for this project, and we should definitely anticipate good results on the contest,</p>
